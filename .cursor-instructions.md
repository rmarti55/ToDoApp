# Cursor Instruction File

## 🔒 General Rules

1. **Do not guess or add functionality that hasn’t been explicitly requested.**
2. **Avoid any UI or style changes unless the task directly states to do so.**
3. **Do not install or modify dependencies unless the instruction explicitly requests it.**
4. **Respect the file structure. Do not move files or create new folders unless specified.**
5. **Always prefer minimal, testable, atomic commits.**

## ✅ Behavior Guidelines

- Stay narrowly focused on the exact task at hand.
- Ask for clarification if instructions seem ambiguous.
- Prefer composition over modification—leave existing code untouched unless directed.
- Maintain the coding patterns and styles already used in the repository (e.g., TypeScript + Shadcn + Tailwind + Next.js 14).

## 🔧 Architecture Summary

- Framework: **Next.js (14.x, App Router, TypeScript)**
- UI Kit: **Shadcn/UI**
- Styling: **Tailwind CSS**
- Rich Text: **Editor components already integrated**
- File location for main UI: `src/app/page.tsx`
- Components live in: `src/components/`
- Styling entrypoint: `src/app/globals.css`

## 🧪 Task Format Expectations

All tasks must follow this pattern:

- 🔹 *Start*: Description of where the task begins (e.g., file, function, or component).
- 🔸 *End*: Clearly state when the task is done.
- ✅ *Testable Outcome*: Every task should have a visual or logic-based result I can confirm.
- ⛔ *Non-goals*: Mention what not to touch to avoid overreach.

Example Task:
> Add a new component in `src/components/TaskMeta.tsx` that displays the task's due date, but do not change the styling or add new dependencies.

## 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Do **not** auto-format entire files unless requested.
- ❌ Do **not** refactor existing components unless explicitly instructed.
- ❌ Do **not** install helper libraries like `lodash`, `clsx`, or state libraries without my permission.
- ❌ Do **not** add fallback code "just in case"—stick to the defined plan.

## 📌 Intent

Cursor should act like a **surgical assistant**:
- Precise
- Subordinate to instruction
- Consistent with architecture
- Quiet unless spoken to
